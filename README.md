# My first to do list ;)


### foreword
So, first of all I would say the following thoughts:

Somehow I was sitting in a room somewhere in Minsk and thought about how often I see and hear about to Do lists. Literally everyone does them. I thought that I was not a sucker after all and should also do such a thing as one of the first projects. And I am ready to present you my creation.

It's my first sigle project, uploaded to github and second traing project powered with Reactjs. Some moments of the work done suit me, some make me tear out my eyes (and my hands too), but it doesn't matter. One cannot but appreciate the experience that I received during development: familiarity with the hooks that I heard about, but did not use, using Ant Design and etc.

## Description

I don't know what to say about ToDoLiSiT, because everyone knows what is it ;)
So, it's an application powered with Reactjs as I said before, that is meant to store our dreams and plans. By the way, way ur able to use some extra possibilities provided by this application. About this possibilities you will know later.
